            When I think of my mother
            No one compares to her
            A love like no other
            She puts everyone else first
            And when I was younger
            I treated her the worst
            Never known someone stronger
            'Cause damn it must've hurt
            I don't see you as much as I used to
            But if I did, I know what I would do
            I'd tell you I love you a million times
            Say that I'm sorry if I made you cry
            Could never be half the woman even if I tried
            But I'll try, I swear I'll try
            If someone puts me down, yeah, I know my worth
            All thanks to you, the lessons that I've learnt
            If I had to put it into words
            I think of an angel and all I see is her
            All I see is her
            Your voice in my head and
            It tells me I'm beautiful
            And when I have children
            I'll pass on the things I was told
            I don't see you as much as I used to

            A love like no other
            She puts everyone else first

            Never known someone stronger
            'Cause damn it must've hurt
            I don't see you as much as I used to
            But if I did, I know what I would do
            I'd tell you I love you a million times
            Say that I'm sorry if I made you cry
            Could never be half the woman even if I tried
            But I'll try, I swear I'll try
            If someone puts me down, yeah, I know my worth
            All thanks to you, the lessons that I've learnt
            If I had to put it into words
            I think of an angel and all I see is her

            Your voice in my head and
            It tells me I'm beautiful
